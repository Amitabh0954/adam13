# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The input continues to lack a clearly defined folder structure for file organization. Without explicit folder definitions or a determinable structure under the provided target path, it is impossible to generate valid files without violating output constraints.

To proceed effectively, please specify a clear folder structure. Define where files for `controllers`, `models`, `services`, `repositories`, etc., should be placed within your target folder hierarchy. This will ensure compliance with all rules governing path safety and folder completeness.
