# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The input lacks a clearly defined folder structure for organizing the generated files. Without an explicit or determinable folder hierarchy under the provided target path, it is impossible to ensure compliance with strict output rules governing path safety and file coherence.

To proceed, please provide a precise folder structure detailing where the generated files should reside (e.g., folders for `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc.). This guidance will allow me to produce valid output.
