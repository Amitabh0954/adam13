# Error due to Missing Detailed Folder Structure

While the input specifies a target folder path (`8d9e9302929840cda71be1ee98e44c40-folder-structure/`) and user stories, it lacks a detailed sub-folder structure necessary for organizing components like `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc. Clear folder organization is mandatory for compliant file generation.

To proceed, please provide a detailed folder structure under the target directory.
