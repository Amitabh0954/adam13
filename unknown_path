Based on the provided folder structure and user story, we will implement the user registration functionality with the necessary constraints and validations. The feature will ensure that email is unique and password meets security criteria. 

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Define the User model with appropriate constraints for email and password.**
2. **Implement a repository for user account operations.**
3. **Implement services for user registration ensuring email uniqueness and password security criteria.**
4. **Implement a controller to expose the API for user registration.**
5. **Update routes to include the new user registration endpoint.**
6. **Update MySQL database schema to ensure constraints are applied.**
7. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**
8. **Update requirements.txt with necessary dependencies.**
