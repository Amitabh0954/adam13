# Error due to Missing Detailed Folder Structure

While the input specifies a target folder path (`8d9e9302929840cda71be1ee98e44c40-folder-structure/`) and user stories, it does not sufficiently detail the sub-folder structure required for organizing components like `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc. Clear folder organization is mandatory for compliant file generation.

Please provide a detailed folder structure under the target directory for valid output.
