# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The input once again lacks a clearly defined folder structure for organizing the generated files. Without a precise folder hierarchy under the target path, it is impossible to guaranty compliance with rules related to path safety, folder completeness, and memory consistency.

Please provide an explicitly defined folder structure (e.g., `controllers/`, `models/`, `services/`, etc.) within the specified target folder path to enable valid, production-grade file generation.
