# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The provided input is still missing a clear folder structure within the specified target path. Without an explicit or determinable file organization schema, I cannot ensure compliance with strict rules governing file paths, folder completeness, and dependency resolution.

To proceed, please provide a detailed folder structure under the target folder path (e.g., folders like `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc.). This will enable compliant, production-grade file generation.
