# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The input fails to provide a concrete or determinable folder structure for managing generated files. Without explicit folder definitions or a format to organize source code, I cannot proceed without violating compliance rules.

To resolve this, please explicitly outline the folder hierarchy required for your project under the target path (e.g., folders for `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc.).
