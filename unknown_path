# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The folder structure necessary for organizing the generated files under the specified target path is not explicitly defined. Without this detailed structure (e.g., `controllers/`, `models/`, `services/`, etc.), it is not possible to ensure compliance with path safety, folder completeness, and memory consistency rules.

Please clearly specify the folder hierarchy within the target directory to allow for valid file generation.
