# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The folder structure is missing or undefined. Without an explicit or deterministic folder layout provided for creating valid file paths, it is impossible to proceed without violating the constraints of structured output generation.

To ensure compliance, please clearly define the folder structure under the target path to organize the files. For example, specify folders like `controllers`, `models`, `services`, or similar relevant to the use case.
