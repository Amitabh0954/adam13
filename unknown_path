# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The folder structure is not explicitly provided or determinable from the given input. Without a precise or inferable folder hierarchy guiding file placement, proceeding would violate compliance rules on path safety.

To continue, please specify a detailed folder structure under the target path to organize files properly (e.g., separate folders for `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc.).
