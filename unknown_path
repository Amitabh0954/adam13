# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The provided input does not explicitly define the required folder structure under the target folder path, leaving it ambiguous where files such as `controllers`, `models`, or `services` should reside. Clear folder definitions are necessary to ensure compliance with the strict path safety and folder completeness rules.

To proceed, please specify the precise folder structure for the project under the target directory, ensuring clarity on where each file type should be created. This will enable valid, rules-compliant file generation.
