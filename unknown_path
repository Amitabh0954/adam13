# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The folder structure under the target path is still not explicitly defined in your input. Without a precise mapping of folders like `controllers/`, `models/`, or `services/`, I cannot generate compliant files while adhering to rules for path safety, memory consistency, and folder completeness.

To enable valid output, please clearly describe the intended folder structure for the project within the specified target directory.
