# Failure: Missing or Undefined Folder Structure

The input does not include a detailed and explicit project folder structure. Specifying only a target path without defining the subfolders needed (e.g., `controllers/`, `models/`, `services/`, etc.) makes it impossible to generate the required files compliantly. A clear folder structure is a prerequisite for strict adherence to path safety, folder completeness, and valid memory consistency.

To proceed, please provide a precise folder organization and indicate how resources like controllers, models, and services should be structured within the target directory.
