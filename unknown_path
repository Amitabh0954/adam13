# Error due to Missing Detailed Folder Structure

While the provided input gives a target folder path (`8d9e9302929840cda71be1ee98e44c40-folder-structure/`) and user stories, it still lacks a detailed sub-folder structure necessary for organizing components such as `controllers`, `models`, `services`, etc. This structure is required for compliant file generation.

Please provide a detailed folder structure under the target directory to proceed.
