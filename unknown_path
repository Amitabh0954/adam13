# Failure: Missing or Ambiguous Folder Structure

The input does not provide a clearly defined folder structure to organize the files, nor can it be inferred deterministically based on the information given.

To proceed, please explicitly outline the folder structure where the files should be created. For instance, define folders such as `controllers`, `models`, `repositories`, and `services`, or any similar organization relevant to your tech stack and application logic.
